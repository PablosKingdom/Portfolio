    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>This website portfolio was built as part of my university application in the field of computing and web development. It demonstrates my technical interests and motivation to transition into tech. The project is a personal portfolio site, featuring my CV, skills, experience, and educational background. It was made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is intended for university admissions review.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="design">
    <h2>Design Elements</h2>
    <p>The site includes the following front-end design elements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clean and minimalist layout with a futuristic, dark theme</li>
      <li>Responsive navigation with anchor links</li>
      <li>Well-structured content sections: About, Skills, Experience, Education, Contact</li>
      <li>Custom CSS for visual presentation and font styling</li>
      <li>Form layout for potential interaction (static only)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No back-end features were implemented, as this is a static single-page site.</p>

  <section id="ux">
    <h2>UX/UI Critique: Pinterest Web Version</h2>
    <p>Pinterest offers a visually appealing and highly image-centric user interface. Its infinite scroll feature keeps users engaged by continuously loading new content without manual pagination. The masonry grid layout is both functional and visually satisfying, accommodating different image sizes seamlessly.</p>
    <p>However, the UX suffers from aggressive prompts for user sign-up, especially for first-time visitors. Attempting to browse without an account is difficult, with most content becoming blurred or hidden after a few scrolls. This hinders casual exploration and could turn potential users away. A more subtle onboarding approach would improve retention.</p>
    <p>Overall, Pinterest nails visual presentation but sacrifices accessibility for non-users. Improvements could include delayed sign-up prompts and limited, but open, guest browsing functionality.</p>

  <section id="analytics">
    <h2>Website Analytics Report</h2>
    <p>To simulate a basic marketing effort, we assume this portfolio website was promoted through an Instagram ad campaign targeting tech enthusiasts and university recruiters. The campaign led to a total of 250 visits within the first week.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Average time on site: 1 minute 25 seconds</li>
      <li>Bounce rate: 30%</li>
      <li>Top-performing section: "Projects" with 45% of all interactions</li>
      <li>Traffic sources: Instagram (61%), Direct (25%), Google Search (14%)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data suggests that Instagram was an effective platform for engagement. The "Projects" section drew the most interest, indicating it should remain a focus point. Next steps could include integrating a live contact form and more detailed project breakdowns.</p>
